# OpenClassrooms-P7-OCPizza

In the seventh project of OpenClassrooms, our focus is on creating the technical specifications for OCPizza.  
This exercise provides an opportunity to familiarize ourselves with several important concepts:

1. Database Design:
   - Understand the world of databases and create UML diagrams such as the Conceptual Data Model and Logical Data Model.

2. Database Creation:
   - Utilize MySQLWorkbench to create a database, considering the requirements and specifications of OCPizza.

3. Project Methodology:
   - Select an appropriate project method, such as the V Cycle, to guide the development process and ensure effective project management.

4. GANTT Diagram:
   - Create a GANTT diagram to visualize and plan the project timeline, identifying tasks, dependencies, and milestones.

5. RACI Diagram:
   - Develop a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed) diagram to define and allocate project roles and responsibilities.

Through this project, we will gain valuable insights into database design, project methodologies and project management practices.
